Spam filtering is a critical issue in todayâ€™s digital communi- cation landscape, where the prevalence of unsolicited elec- tronic messages disrupts not only efficient communication but also poses significant threats to information security and user privacy. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms in spam filtering, focusing on Naive Bayes classifier, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) clas- sifiers. Using the spam dataset, we employ advanced text pre- processing techniques and feature extraction methods, such as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), to enhance the performance of our classifiers. Our results show that the SVM classifier outperforms the other classi- fiers, achieving an accuracy of 97.6%, followed by the Naive Bayes classifier at 96.5%, and the kNN classifier at 91.9%. These results emphasize the importance of feature engineer- ing and preprocessing in achieving accurate classification and highlight the potential for using advanced machine learning techniques in developing effective spam filtering systems.
